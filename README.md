# This repository has the code of a drone (Arduino and ESP8266)-based project 
For recruiters, please call +91 70580316487 (WhatsApp if unreachable) to get a better understanding of the whole project.  

This repo has almost **no clean code** and **no comments** and it was not intended to have one.  
So please do not expect it to be readable or testable.  
Just make a 5-minute call to get an overview of the project.


The repository has various .ino files (C++) in `Drone's...` folder, which might be confusing<br> and 
can be ignored due to the non-existence of proper comments <br> and a lack of explanation of the code snippets in the code.
