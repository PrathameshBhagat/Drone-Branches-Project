# An attempt to build an autonomous drone

# Note 
- The transmitter and reciver was ***programmed completely from scratch*** in JS & C++, saving ₹4K to ₹10K to make delivery of medicines and goods cost effective.


- The ***transmitter*** was self programmed by me and was just a vanilla J.S.  page with two joysticks operated from my smart phone it self.

- The ***receiver*** was as well self programmed in C++ and executed by an ESP8266/ESP 32 board, just a web server serving the J.S. page and providing the recieved pitch, yaw, roll values to the flight controller.

- The ***flight controller*** was an Arduino R3 executing a third party C++ code by the YMFC-AL open source project, not getting an F.C. added savings of atleast ₹5K to ₹10K.

- The drone isn't very stable cause the **PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative)** values need to be tuned and lacking an aeronautics background made it difficult to tune those values.
